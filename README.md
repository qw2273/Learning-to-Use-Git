# **How to Use Git**

## What is repository?
- The combination of  1. the files and directories that you create and edit directly, and 2. the extra information that Git records about the project's history. 
- Git stores all of its extra information in a directory called `<.git >`located in the root directory of the repository. You should **never edit or delete anything** in  `<.git >`.

## Useful command List 
- Go  to specific repository: `<cd repository name>`
