# **How to Use Git**

## What is repository?
- The combination of  1. the files and directories that you create and edit directly, and 2. the extra information that Git records about the project's history. 
- Git stores all of its extra information in a directory called `.git`located in the root directory of the repository. You should **never edit or delete anything** in  `.git`.

## Useful command List 
* Go  to specific repository: `cd repository name` 
* Check status of a repository: `git status`
* Check what has been changed: `git diff`
                              *
